About Walk
==========

Walk is a "Windows Application Library Kit" for the Go Programming Language.

It includes packages for 2-D drawing, graphical user interfaces, printing and
more. The goal is to have a library that makes developing a Windows Desktop
application using the Go Programming Language an easy walk.

For now it will be restricted to those apis that are available out of the box on
Windows XP SP3.

Is it ready for production work?
================================

No, there is a lot of stuff missing and some existing parts may need to be
redone. Don't rely on anything here to be stable yet, it will take some time.

Setup
=====

1. Make sure you have a working Go installation and build environment, 
   see this go-nuts post for details:
   http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/5c87630a84f4fd0c
   
   Updated versions of the Windows Go build are available here:
   http://code.google.com/p/gomingw/downloads/list
   
2. git clone https://github.com/lxn/walk.git

3. cd walk/src && gomake

Using Walk
==========

See the examples directory for inspiration. Docs may appear as time permits ;)

Some features of the Walk gui package require an application manifest file
alongside your executable, to make use of common controls 6.0. See the examples
directory for such a file.

You should be aware that this project is far from being mature - anything could
break or change without warning.

Contribute
==========

Contributions in form of design, code, documentation, bug reporting or other
ways you see fit are very welcome.
