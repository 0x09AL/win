CALLBACKS BRANCH WARNING
========================

It seems right now there are some stack overflow problems when using callbacks.

Maybe you want to check out the master branch instead, which requires a helper
dll, but is currently more "stable".

About Walk
==========

Walk is a "Windows Application Library Kit" for the Go Programming Language.

It includes packages for 2-D drawing, graphical user interfaces, printing and
more. The goal is to have a library that makes developing a Windows Desktop
application using the Go Programming Language an easy walk.

For now it will be restricted to those apis that are available out of the box on
Windows XP SP3.

Is it ready for production work?
================================

No, there is a lot of stuff missing and some existing parts may need to be
redone. Don't rely on anything here to be stable yet, it will take some time.

Setup
=====

As the Go toolchain makes crosscompiling very easy, I code and build on Linux
and use Windows only to run the executables. Follow this guide if you want to do
the same: http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/c940bb15ef1d2b4e

Now clone the Walk git repo and run make:
$ git clone http://github.com/lxn/walk.git
$ cd walk && gomake

Presently there is one caveat: Windows apps will need window procedures to do
the nice gui stuff, which means Windows will have to call a callback function in
the Go code. This is not possible in the current release of Go though, so there
is an extra hurdle to overcome: You have to apply this patch to your Go
installation and then rebuild it: http://codereview.appspot.com/1696051/

Some features of the Walk gui package require an application manifest file
alongside your executable, to make use of common controls 6.0. See the examples
directory for such a file.

Using Walk
==========

See the examples directory for inspiration. Docs may appear as time permits ;)

You should be aware that this project is far from being mature - anything could
break or change without warning.

Please open an issue on the tracker if you encounter a bug.

Contribute
==========

Contributions in form of design, code, documentation, bug reporting or other
ways you see fit are very welcome.

Thank You!
